Why write our own CSV importer?

-We need to insert pauses so we can return control to the browser
 regularly - otherwise the browser will hang.

-Ideally would like to change it to return a continuation, so we load
the file while processing, rather than loading the entire file into
memory. Haven't seen a CSV tool that'll do that.

-We specifically want everything to stay in the format it was
 originally - coercing values to numbers may be the wrong approach. I
 haven't found a CSV library that doesn't attempt this. Note that
 converting the text to numbers is in fact the correct option the vast
 majority of the time, so everyone else is doing it right.
