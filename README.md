=========

This is a short program to provide organizations with the ability to share lists of e-mail addresses for list chaperones or swaps. It's implemented in HTML and JavaScript.

Usage Notes
-----------

This project uses submodules, which Github does not automatically download. Until this is fixed, make sure to either `git submodule update --init` after cloning, or download the [`FileSaver.js`][1] project and place it into the content/FileSaver directory if you downloaded the ZIP file.

This project is currently under development. More documentation will be added soon.
